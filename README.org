* cutegirl
note: currently only linux is supported, maybe windows support if i stop being lazy

* features
** time tracking
cutegirl tracks both time spent connected to the server and time spent speaking (note: you will have to give the @all ACL ~Register User~ permission in order for speaking tracking to work properly)

* commands
- ~;lb~ or ~;leaderboard~ prints the leaderboard to the chat
- ~;bring~ brings the bot to your current channel (done via pming)

* building
** requirements
~spdlog~ and ~fmt~ must be installed from your distro's package manager, every other lilbrary is gotten automatically from vcpkg when building

** compiling
simply run
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
#+END_SRC
then move ~cutegirl.conf~ to the build folder and start the bot by running ~build/mumblebot~
