** time tracking
cutegirl tracks both time spent connected to the server and time spent speaking (note: the bot has to be in the same channel as the speaker in order to log it)

* commands
- ~;lb~ or ~;leaderboard~ prints the leaderboard to the chat
- ~;bring~ brings the bot to your current channel (done via pming)

* building
simply run
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
#+END_SRC
then move ~cutegirl.conf~ to the build folder and start the bot by running ~build/mumblebot~
